This commit adds an optional Constant speed movement option for Mousekeys.

This allows for a constant movement speed with Mousekeys which may allow for more precise movement.

Check out the [documentation](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_mouse_keys?id=configuring-the-behavior-of-mousekeys-with-3-speed-constant-movement)!
