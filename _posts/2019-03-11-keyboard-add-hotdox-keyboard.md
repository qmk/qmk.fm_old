We've added support for the [HotDox](https://shop.alpacakeyboards.com/) keyboard from [Alpaca Keyboards](https://www.alpacakeyboards.com/)!

Check out this keyboard on the [QMK Configurator](https://config.qmk.fm/#/hotdox/LAYOUT_ergodox).

You can also find the [Kono Store](https://kono.store/products/ergodox-hotdox).
