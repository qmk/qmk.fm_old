This updates a number of parts for the Split Keyboard code, to get it more ready for ARM Support (no, not here yet).

This PR: 

* Eliminates the need for the RGB/Backlit dirty flags
* Move over to i2c_master.c and i2c_slave.c for i2c transport (a large leap forward to ARM support)
* Support greater than 8 columns for i2c-based split keyboards

Remember, you will need to flash both controllers with this update, since it changes the communication code.
