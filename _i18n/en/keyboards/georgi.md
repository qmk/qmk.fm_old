# Georgi! A 20% Steno/QWERTY

{% include badge.html path="georgi" %}

![Georgi!](/keyboards/georgi/flashy.jpg)

Georgi is a 2x12 Split Ortho keyboard for general use and stenography. Integrating a built-in steno engine on top of QMK, it's an ergonomic and economical wonder. Sporting full QWERTY support, easy chording and a well-designed/extensible firmware, it's not only the inexpensive way to try steno, but the most ergonomic and hacker friendly. Shipping with 12g switches, this is optimized for chording usage.

### Georgi is available from **[g Heavy Industries](http://gboards.ca)**.

## Steno Engine
Georgi sports an onboard chording engine allowing you to define what various chords (similar to combos) do easily. This engine is the core of what makes Georgi special as it operates on chords as opposed to layers and sequences of keys. With over 263 Decillion possible combinations, a single layer is more than enough :)

In addition to typical serial steno over GeminiPR, Georgi can act as a NKRO keyboard for Plover use.

## Gaming Mode
Steno engine aside, there is a traditional QMK layer based option accessible from the default firmware. This allows you to access your traditional QMK layers and goodness, making for an excellent gaming pad.

## Keymaps/Documentation
Keymaps, precompiled firmware and instructions are hosted over on the [gBoards Docs](http://docs.gboards.ca/).

Here are the default keymaps.
