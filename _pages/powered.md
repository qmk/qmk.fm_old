## Keyboards Powered by QMK

If you'd like to advertise QMK compatibility, or use QMK as the default and official firmware for your keyboard, we ask that you do the following:

1. Submit a [Pull Request](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pulls/) with support for your keyboard†
2. Consider using one of the badges below on your product's webpage, and linking to http://qmk.fm

<small>†If you need help with this, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/issues), and we'd be happy to help! A schematic of your keyboard, and as much information you can provide would be helpful</small>

If your project does use QMK as the default and official firmware, we'd like to add it to the list on the homepage, so [let us know](https://github.com/qmk/qmk.fm/issues) if it's not there!

## Badges

These are the default-sized badges:

<style>
td {
    border: 0;
}
</style>

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><a href="/assets/images/badge-dark.svg"><img src="/assets/images/badge-dark.svg" alt="QMK Badge Dark" /></a></td>
        <td><a href="/assets/images/badge-light.svg"><img src="/assets/images/badge-light.svg" alt="QMK Badge Light" /></a></td>
    </tr>
</table>

A smaller version of each:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><a href="/assets/images/badge-small-dark.svg"><img src="/assets/images/badge-small-dark.svg" alt="QMK Badge Small Dark" /></a></td>
        <td><a href="/assets/images/badge-small-light.svg"><img src="/assets/images/badge-small-light.svg" alt="QMK Badge Small Light" /></a></td>
    </tr>
</table>

And badges for compatible or community-supported keyboards:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><a href="/assets/images/badge-community-dark.svg"><img src="/assets/images/badge-community-dark.svg" alt="QMK Community Badge Dark" /></a></td>
        <td><a href="/assets/images/badge-community-light.svg"><img src="/assets/images/badge-community-light.svg" alt="QMK Community Badge Light" /></a></td>
    </tr>
</table>

Please do not use modified versions these images - if you'd like to use something different, [let us know](https://github.com/qmk/qmk.fm/issues), and we'll do our best to accomodate your wishes!
