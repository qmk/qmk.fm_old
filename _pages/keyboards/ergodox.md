{% include badge.html path="ergodox" %}

A split ortholinear mechanical keyboard. Open-source design. Available commercially at [ErgoDox-EZ.com](https://ergodox-ez.com). Comes fully assembled with a two-year warranty.

A different, ARM-based design called ErgoDox Infinity is periodically available in kit form via [Massdrop](https://www.massdrop.com/buy/infinity-ergodox). 

## Graphical configurator

A graphical configurator that uses QMK in the backend is available at [configure.ergodox-ez.com](http://configure.ergodox-ez.com). The configurator outputs Hex files as well as C files which can be used as a jumping-off point in a local QMK installation.

## ErgoDox EZ docs repo

A separate [GitHub Repo](github.com/ergodox-ez/docs) features some ErgoDox-EZ specific hardware files, such as the PCB diagrams.
