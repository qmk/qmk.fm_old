Gergo is a 14x4 ortholinear, 50-key keyboard kit, made by [g Heavy Industries](http://gboards.ca). Supporting MX, Alps and Choc switches and with an onboard processor, it's one of the lowest profile QMK boards available at the moment. With fullsize mods and a thin profile, Gergo is a great addition to your desk or your bag!
