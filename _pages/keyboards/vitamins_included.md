# Vitamins included

{% include badge.html path="vitamins_included" %}

The Vitamins included is a variant of the Let's Split.
It started out as a DIY kit, for a version of the Let's Split using kailh sockets,
and then grew into this version, and got the name "Vitamins Included", because no soldering is required. Everything is on the PCB.

Like the Let's split, it's a split 40% board (4x6 on each half), that uses an ATMega32U4, and Serial or I2C to communicate between the halves.
It also has spots for WS2812 underglow, and a buzzer, if one wishes to add that.
