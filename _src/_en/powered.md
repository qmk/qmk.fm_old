# The QMK Trademark

"QMK Firmware" and the logo are a trademark registered by Jack Humbert to help encourage keyboard makers to contribute back to the community and to help the community offer support for the keyboards running QMK. 

Anyone is entitled and encouraged to use the logo, the term "QMK (Firmware)", "Powered by QMK (Firmware)" (or similar wording with "running", "compatible with", etc) provided they:

1. Don't imply QMK or its contributors endorse/make the keyboard
2. [Contribute their keyboard's configuration back to qmk:master roughly by the keyboard's ship date](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pulls/)
3. Link to the [QMK website](https://qmk.fm) or [Github repo](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) on their product page

Images with the logo and preferred wording to use on PCBs, print-outs, websites, stickers, merch, etc are below.

## Optional steps

1. Request a tag (`<keyboard>-<version>` e.g. `planck-4.2`) of the commit shipped with the keyboard in [qmk/qmk_firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware). A compiled .hex/.bin is usually added to the release page for this.
2. Be aware of [GPL compliance](https://fsfe.org/activities/ftf/useful-tips-for-vendors.en.html) - having a tag in the repo helps with this.

If your project uses QMK as the default and official firmware, we'd like to add it to the list on the homepage, so [let us know by creating an pull request on qmk/qmk.fm](https://github.com/qmk/qmk.fm/pulls/) if it's not there!

## Images

These are the default-sized badges in svg format (pngs: [dark](/assets/images/badge-dark.png), [light](/assets/images/badge-light.png)):
